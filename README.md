# Anoma Academy

🔹I built a learning platform.<br>
🔹15 lessons → each covers a different aspect of the Anoma ecosystem: intent basics, solver network, settlement security, MEV, Namada, etc.<br>
🔹TR/EN language support.<br>
🔹At the end of each lesson there’s a quiz → correct answers record your progress.<br>
🔹You see which lessons you’ve completed with green checkmarks.<br>
🔹A “Reset progress” button lets you wipe all progress.<br>
🔹Modern design, lesson cards, progress tracking.<br>

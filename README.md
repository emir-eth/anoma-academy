# Anoma Academy

🔹I built a learning platform.
🔹15 lessons → each covers a different aspect of the Anoma ecosystem: intent basics, solver network, settlement security, MEV, Namada, etc.
🔹TR/EN language support.
🔹At the end of each lesson there’s a quiz → correct answers record your progress.
🔹You see which lessons you’ve completed with green checkmarks.
🔹A “Reset progress” button lets you wipe all progress.
🔹Modern design, lesson cards, progress tracking.
